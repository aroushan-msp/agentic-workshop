# User Stories Development Plan

## Project Overview
Create user stories for a job application management site that allows applicants to search, view, and apply to job postings.

## Development Steps

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & Initial User Stories
- [ ] **Step 1:** Analyze the high-level requirement and identify key user personas
  - *Note: Need confirmation on whether to focus only on applicants or include other personas (recruiters, admins)*
- [ ] **Step 2:** Define core user journeys for job applicants
- [ ] **Step 3:** Create comprehensive user stories covering all applicant functionalities
- [ ] **Step 4:** Write initial user stories to `agentic-hackathon/user_stories.md`

### Phase 2: Story Grouping & Unit Definition
- [ ] **Step 5:** Analyze user stories for cohesion and coupling
- [ ] **Step 6:** Group stories into independent, cohesive units
  - *Note: Need confirmation on team size assumptions for unit sizing*
- [ ] **Step 7:** Define unit boundaries and dependencies
- [ ] **Step 8:** Validate that units are loosely coupled

### Phase 3: Detailed User Stories with Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Step 9:** Enhance each user story with detailed acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Step 10:** Add technical considerations and edge cases
- [ ] **Step 11:** Review story completeness and testability
- [ ] **Step 12:** Write final organized user stories to `agentic-hackathon/final_user_stories.md`

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Step 13:** Review all deliverables for completeness
- [ ] **Step 14:** Ensure stories follow INVEST principles (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)
- [ ] **Step 15:** Final validation of unit independence and cohesion
